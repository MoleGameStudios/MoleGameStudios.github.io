# Introduction to Mole Game Studios

Welcome to my website and devlog!<br>
This post will say a little about me and what I'm currently working on.

## Who am I?

- I am a solo indie game developer from the UK working on a game called 'The Book of Dave'.
- I have been interested in gaming as long as I can remember, and have been making small games since I was 9.

## What am I doing?

### Mole Game Studios

- I have always dreamed of having my own game studio, and decided 'why not?'.
- In the future I plan to get more people onboard with projects, but do not have the need or budget to do so at the moment.

### The Book of Dave

- **The Book of Dave** is a story driven platformer, focusing on the journey of *Dave the Blobfish* through the oceans,
- Like the name suggests, the game will be organised like a *book*, organised into chapters.
    - Each Chapter of the game will focus on a significant portion of Dave's life and journeys, bringing new environments and themes.
    - I aim to release the game a chapter at a time.
- I have been working on this game on and off for 2 years, but recently switched from GameMaker Studio to C# with the Monogame framework, so a fresh start.
#### When will it come out?
- I have no idea.
- I am currently going through exams, and have limited time to make the game, and will not release it until I am happy with it, so it will take a while; but it will be worth the wait.
- The story for the game is basically done, but the codebase is still in the initail stages.
